# PyCitySchools with Pandas

## Overview
This project analyzed school and student data to determine the relationships between funding, size, etc., and grade outcomes.

### Purpose

We have been asked by Maria, the Chief Data Scientist for the City school district, to help analyze data on school funding and its effects on the standardized testing of students. We were given 2 datasets - one with metrics for each school in the district, and one with data on individual students. 

The only issue we noticed with the data was that some students had titles before and/or after their names - something that was easily fixed with a couple lines of code.

We were then tasked with providing the district with a high level snapshot of the district's key metrics, an overview of key metrics for each school within the district, and mulitipe tables which presented the top 5 best and worst performing schools, the average math and reading scores for each grade in each school, and general school performance as based on a school's budget per student, size, and the type of school (District or Charter). 

Unfortunately, once we had completed our initial analysis, it was brought to our attention that the 9th graders at Thomas High School likely had their grades altered. Although the school board was still unsure of the extent of the academic dishonesty at the time, we were tasked with removing the grades from the 9th graders at Thomas High School and rerunning our analysis to uphold state-testing standards. 


## Results

### Initial Results



### Post-Cheating Results

Bulleted list addressing how each of the seven school district metrics was affected by the changes in the data

- How is the district summary affected?
- How is the school summary affected?
- How does replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance relative to the other schools?
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect:
  - Math and reading scores by grade
  - Scores by school spending
  - Scores by school size
  - Scores by school type


### Differences?
